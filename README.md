Title: Digital Data Transmission System Of KSRTC

Description: This project implements a digital data transmission system for Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to improve efficiency and real-time data collection.

Problem Addressed: Manual data transfer from Electronic Ticketing Machines (ETMs) to the Host PC was time-consuming and prone to errors.

Solution:

Real-time Data Transmission: After each ticket generation, data is transferred directly to the KSRTC server.
Inventory Management System: A web-based system manages inventory, vendors, and products.

Benefits:

Revenue Protection: Improved revenue tracking and reduced fraud.
Time Efficiency: Faster data processing and reduced waiting times at bus stations.
Demand Management: Real-time data allows for dynamic bus deployment based on passenger demand.
Reduced Manual Effort: Streamlines data collection and minimizes human error.
